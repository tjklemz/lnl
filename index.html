	  <h1>Postmodern Design</h1>
		<p>Postmodernism attempts to limit the limitless; to unbind the bounded. Having something to say is itself a boundary as not everyone will listen. Postmodern design always has something to say. Postmodern design relates the unrelated. Postmodern design is not concerned with looks or style but instead, diversity. It is no longer the voice of the designer but now the voice of the content. Postmodern design transcends the temporal through the use of story. Postmodern design deals with things in motion as mediums constantly change. Postmodernism uses the language of abstraction to bring simplicity, understanding, and order to the chaotic. Postmodernism seeks the eternal in the temporal, the temporal in the eternal.</p>
